## Months after switching over, here are a few things we saw:
* The community around React & RN is very vibrant
* Growing pains & bugs of using a relatively new framework are getting smaller each day
* Our apps feel MUCH more native than other hybrid solutions we've used
* Development time was reduced (from native especially, but also PhoneGap)
* 100% of our team can work on our mobile projects
