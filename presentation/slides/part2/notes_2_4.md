#### Arrow Functions

If returning a value immediately, `{ return ... }` isn't needed.

If there is only one parameter, the parenthesis aren't required either.


Aside from being more pleasant to read/write, arrow functions also have no binding of `this`, which helps with various issues commonly encountered.
