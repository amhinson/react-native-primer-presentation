#### `const` and `let`

**EDIT CODE ON SLIDE**

const name = 'Alex';
name = 'Adam'; // ERROR

let job = 'Musician';
job = 'Developer';

Replacements for `var`

`const` is a signal that the identifier won’t be reassigned.

`let`, is a signal that the variable may be reassigned.It also signals that the variable will be used only in the block it’s defined in.

No more reason to use `var`.
