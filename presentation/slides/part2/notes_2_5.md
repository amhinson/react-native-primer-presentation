#### Destructuring

**EDIT CODE ON SLIDE**

const { name, email } = currentUser;

__**ASSIGN TO NEW NAME**__

const { FIRSTNAME: firstName } = user;

console.log(firstName);

Take properties out of an object and assign them to a variable with the same name.

You can also assign them to different variables and still use destructuring.
