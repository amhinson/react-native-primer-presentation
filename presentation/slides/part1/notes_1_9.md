## NATIVE API
* RN exposes a large number of native APIs so you can interact with native modules:
  * Alerts, Push Notifications, Geolocation, Camera, Photo Library, etc.
* For native modules that aren't currently exposed by RN, there is mostly likely another 3rd party library that does:
  * Calendar, Reminders, Maps, etc
