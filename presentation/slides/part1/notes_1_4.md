## WHAT MAKES RN DIFFERENT
* Based on the JavaScript framework React
* Rendered real native UI components instead of a web view, which helps the app “feel native” (gestures, etc.)
* Better performance than other hybrid solutions
* Has hot reloading option so you can update your app without recompiling
* Easily use native code when required
* Can be used inside a native application
