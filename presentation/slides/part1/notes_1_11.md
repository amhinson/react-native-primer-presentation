## BRIDGE
* RN apps are fully native, but contain a JavaScript thread where the logic of the app is run.
* The JS thread communicates with the native code by talking over a “bridge”, where data is being sent back and forth between the two.
### This isn't something that you will actively be aware of unless you need to write native code for your app.
