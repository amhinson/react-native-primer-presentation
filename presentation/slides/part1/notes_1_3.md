## REACT NATIVE PRECONCEPTIONS
* Just another hybrid framework that “wraps” a website and calls it an app
* Write once, run everywhere
  * RN by default will run on iOS and Android, but it also gives you the option to create unique experiences that are platform specific.
  * Mostly portable from React, but still requires adjustments
